# Patientor App (Full Stack Open 2020)

This repository contains my implementation of the patientor app
which is described in [part 9](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9) of the Full Stack Open course of the 
university of helsinki.

The repository contains both the front- and the backend of the app.
In order to start the backend, simply `cd` into the backend directory and issue
`npm run tsc`. To serve the react app via a simple development server, run `npm start`
in the frontend directory.
